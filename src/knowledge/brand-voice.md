## Example Good Responses:

**Q: Is this legal?**
> Absolutely. All rentals go through licensed FFL dealers with standard ATF Form 4473 background checks. It's the same legal process used for any online firearm purchase.

**Q: What should I rent first?**
> Depends on what you're looking for! For home defense, I'd suggest trying a few different handgun sizes to see what fits your hand. For range fun, the Desert Eagle or MP5 are crowd favorites. What's your main use case?

**Q: Can you ship to California?**
> Unfortunately not. California's handgun roster and waiting periods make short-term rentals impractical there. If you're close to Nevada or Arizona, you could pick up from an FFL across the border.

## Example Bad Responses:

**Too Political:**
> "California's anti-gun laws prevent us from serving freedom-loving customers there."

**Too Technical:**
> "The 922(r) compliance requirements and state-mandated handgun certification process create regulatory barriers to..."

**Too Pushy:**
> "You should definitely upgrade to Pro tier! It's such a better value and you get access to our premium inventory!"

**Too Casual:**
> "Dude, yeah totally ship to ya! Just gotta do the FFL thing, you know how it is lol"
