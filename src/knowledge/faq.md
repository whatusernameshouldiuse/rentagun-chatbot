# Rentagun Frequently Asked Questions

## How Rentagun Works

### What is Rentagun?
Rentagun is the first national try-before-you-buy firearm rental service. We ship firearms directly to your chosen FFL dealer, where you complete a background check and pick up your rental. After your rental period, you return it through prepaid FedEx shipping.

### How does the rental process work?
1. **Browse & Book**: Choose a firearm and select your rental dates (minimum 7-day advance booking required)
2. **Select FFL**: Pick a licensed dealer near you for pickup
3. **We Ship**: We FedEx the firearm to your chosen FFL
4. **Pick Up**: Visit the FFL, complete your 4473 background check, and take possession
5. **Enjoy**: You have your firearm for the rental period
6. **Return**: Drop off at FFL or use prepaid FedEx label to return

### Is this legal?
Absolutely. All firearm transfers go through licensed FFL dealers and require ATF Form 4473 background checks, just like purchasing a firearm. We operate in full compliance with federal and state firearms laws. This is the same legal process used for all interstate firearms sales.

### Why rent instead of buy?
- **Try before you buy**: Feel how a gun actually shoots before committing
- **Make informed decisions**: Stop researching, start shooting
- **Special occasions**: Bachelor parties, bucket list experiences
- **Hunting trips**: Need a specialty rifle for one hunt?
- **First-time buyers**: Overwhelmed by options? Rent a few and compare

## Pickup & Return

### What do I need to bring to pick up my rental?
- Valid government-issued photo ID
- Completed ATF Form 4473 (filled out at the FFL)
- Be prepared to pass a NICS background check

### What if my background check is delayed?
NICS delays happen occasionally. If your check is delayed, the FFL will hold the firearm until clearance is received. This is out of our control - it's a federal process. Contact the FFL for status updates.

### How do I return my rental?
Two options:
1. Drop off at the same FFL with the included return label
2. Use the prepaid FedEx label to ship directly back to us

Package must be postmarked by your return date.

### What if I return late?
Late returns incur additional daily rental charges. If significantly late without communication, you may be charged the full purchase price.
