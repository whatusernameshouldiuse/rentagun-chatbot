# FFL (Federal Firearms Licensee) Process

## What is an FFL?

An FFL (Federal Firearms Licensee) is a business licensed by the ATF (Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives) to sell firearms. This includes gun stores, pawn shops with firearms, and some sporting goods stores.

## Why Do I Need an FFL?

Federal law requires all interstate firearm transfers to go through an FFL. This ensures:
- Proper background checks are conducted
- All transfers are logged per federal requirements
- Firearms don't end up in prohibited persons' hands

This is the same process used when buying a gun online - it must ship to an FFL.

## How to Choose an FFL

### During Checkout:
1. Enter your zip code
2. We'll show FFLs near you that we've worked with
3. Choose based on location, hours, and transfer fees
4. We handle contacting them and shipping

### What to Consider:
- **Location**: Pick somewhere convenient for you
- **Hours**: Make sure they're open when you can pick up
- **Transfer fees**: FFLs charge $10-50 for the service
- **Reviews**: Check Google reviews for customer service

### Don't See Your Preferred FFL?
Contact us and we can often add new FFLs to our network. The FFL must:
- Have a valid, current FFL license
- Be willing to receive from commercial shippers
- Complete our dealer verification

## The Pickup Process

### What to Bring:
- Valid government-issued photo ID (driver's license or state ID)
- Second form of ID may be requested
- Nothing else - the FFL handles paperwork

### At the FFL:
1. Tell them you're picking up a Rentagun rental
2. They'll have you fill out ATF Form 4473
3. They'll run your NICS background check
4. Once approved, you take possession

### ATF Form 4473:
This is the standard firearms transfer form required by federal law. It asks:
- Personal information (name, address, DOB)
- Citizenship status
- Eligibility questions (criminal history, mental health, etc.)

**Be truthful** - lying on a 4473 is a federal felony.

### NICS Background Check:
The National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) typically returns:
- **Proceed**: You're good to go (most common)
- **Delay**: FBI needs more time (can take up to 3 business days)
- **Denied**: You cannot take possession

### If You're Delayed:
- This happens to many people, even those with clean records
- Common causes: common name, past arrest (even if not convicted)
- The FFL will hold the firearm
- Contact the FFL for updates, not us (we can't see NICS status)

### If You're Denied:
- You cannot take possession of the firearm
- Contact the FBI's NICS Appeals Service for more information
- We'll arrange return shipping at no cost to you
- Refund issued minus shipping costs

## FFL Fees

FFL dealers charge a transfer fee for their service. This is **in addition** to Rentagun rental fees.

- Typical range: $10-50
- Paid directly to the FFL at pickup
- Not refundable through Rentagun

## Return Process

### Option 1: Drop Off at FFL
- Bring the firearm back to the same FFL
- They'll verify serial number and condition
- Attach the prepaid return label
- Ship it back to us

### Option 2: Direct FedEx Return
- Use the prepaid FedEx label included with your rental
- Package securely in original case
- Drop at FedEx location (not drop box - must be staffed location)
- Keep tracking receipt
