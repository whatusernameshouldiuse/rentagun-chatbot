# State Restrictions

## States We Cannot Serve

Due to state-specific firearms laws, we **cannot ship to** the following states:

### Full Restrictions (No Service)
1. **California** - Handgun roster, assault weapon ban, 10-day waiting period
2. **Connecticut** - Permit requirements, assault weapon ban
3. **Delaware** - Recent restrictions on transfers
4. **Hawaii** - Permit requirements, registration, handgun roster
5. **Illinois (Chicago)** - FOID requirements, local ordinances
6. **Maryland** - Handgun qualification license, assault weapon ban
7. **Massachusetts** - License requirements, handgun roster
8. **New Jersey** - Permit requirements, assault weapon ban
9. **New York** - License requirements, SAFE Act
10. **Rhode Island** - Waiting period, restrictions
11. **Vermont** - Magazine capacity limits, recent restrictions
12. **Washington D.C.** - Registration, permit requirements

### Why These Restrictions?
These states have one or more of:
- Mandatory waiting periods (incompatible with short-term rentals)
- State-specific permits required before taking possession
- Handgun rosters (only approved models can be transferred)
- Assault weapon bans affecting our inventory
- Registration requirements
- Magazine capacity restrictions

We're a small business and cannot maintain compliance across all these varied requirements.

## States With Partial Restrictions

Some states we serve have specific limitations:

### Colorado
- Magazine capacity: 15 rounds
- Some firearms ship with reduced-capacity magazines

### Connecticut
- Currently not serving (see above)

### Nevada (Clark County)
- Background check for private sales (doesn't affect FFL transfers)
- Full service available

### Washington State
- Semi-auto rifle restrictions
- Enhanced background checks
- Full service available for handguns

## What If I'm In a Restricted State?

### Options:
1. **Travel**: Pick up from an FFL in a neighboring unrestricted state
   - You must have legal residence in that state OR
   - Long guns only can transfer to out-of-state residents through FFL

2. **Wait**: Laws change. We monitor and update our service areas.

3. **Contact Us**: Special circumstances may apply. We can discuss options.

### Common Questions:

**I have a CA CCW, can I rent?**
No. State restrictions apply regardless of permits.

**I'm military stationed in California?**
Unfortunately, state of residence laws still apply. If you maintain residence in another state, that may be an option - contact us.

**I'm just visiting a restricted state?**
If you're a resident of an unrestricted state, you can rent and pick up in your home state, then legally transport to most restricted states (check specific state laws).
