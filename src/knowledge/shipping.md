# Shipping Information

## Outbound Shipping (To You)

- **Standard**: 3-5 business days
- **Expedited**: 1-2 business days (+$25)

### What We Ship
- Firearm in hard case
- Magazine(s)

### Signature Required
All shipments require adult signature (21+). The FFL receives and signs for the package.

## Return Shipping (Back to Us)

### Return Deadline
Your rental must be postmarked by your return date. Late returns incur daily charges.

### Two Return Options:

**Option 1: FFL Drop-Off**

## Shipping FAQs

### My tracking shows delivered but FFL says they don't have it?
FedEx deliveries can take 24-48 hours to process at larger stores. Wait a day, then contact FedEx with your tracking number.

### Can I pick up before the FFL calls me?
Call the FFL first. Sometimes packages arrive before they're processed into their system.

### Weather delay?
FedEx weather delays happen. Your rental period starts when the FFL confirms receipt, not the original scheduled date.

### Can I change my FFL after shipping?
Once shipped, we cannot redirect. Plan ahead and confirm your FFL choice.
